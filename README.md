# Voice-Based-Motor-Control
A verilog HDL based project to control a servomotor with voice commands from an android phone.

The project is implemented on an **ALtera DE10-Nano board**. 

The Bluetooth connectivity with the Android phone was done using [**terasIC RFS card**](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=65&No=1025).

The motor control was based on PWM signals passed via a [**terasIC servo motor card**](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=149&No=1028) for voltage regulation.

The Android app used for this project --> [**BluetoothVoiceServo**](https://github.com/sidpethe/BluetoothVoiceServo)
